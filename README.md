PasswordReuse
=============

A Firefox extension to detect password reuse

TODO
====

* API to dynamically update classifications of websites
  (Plain Text Offenders / High Profile sites like banks / PayPal)
* Password Simularity
* Warn user if a website (for which there is a shared password) is compromised
* Warn user if they use the same password for multiple sites
  (Maybe only warn if the site is a plain text offender / high profile?)
* Localization
